Yeast ToolKit registry
======================

Records
-------

Records were amalgamated from 2 sources:

* The YTK zip archive from the *Protocols & Resources* page of the YTK Addgene page
* Each individual Addgene plasmid page

The two records contain different annotations that have been merged into a single
file, so there may be some duplications in the annotations. If so, don't hesitate
to `open an issue <https://github.com/althonos/moclo/issues/new>`_.

Additional annotations
----------------------

* ``CamR`` and ``CmR`` were merged into a single feature
* ``CmR`` have received additional ``db_xref`` qualifiers
