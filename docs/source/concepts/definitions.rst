Molecular Cloning
  Molecular cloning is the process of assembling together fragments of DNA to
  obtain a more complex molecule, often presenting genetic features of interest.
  It describes a *process*, not a *technique*


GoldenGate
  GoldenGate is a molecular cloning technique that uses Type IIS restriction
  enzymes to cut and assemble DNA sequences into recombinant DNA molecules.
  It describes a *technique*


Modular Cloning
  A Modular Cloning system uses the GoldenGate technique to assemble several
  genetic *modules* of a given level into a *vector* of the same level. It can
  also define *types*, which are modules or vectors with specific overhangs
  that are collections of sequences that are functionnally and structuraly
  equivalent to each other.


MoClo
  MoClo is originally the name of a modular cloning system published by the
  Marillonnet Lab which defines a set of vectors and modules to be used to
  assemble multigenic expression devices for plants. An extension was later
  provided by the same team proposing potentially infinite assemblies multigenic
  expression devices with the addition of two levels.
  Other modular cloning systems, inspired by them, were published under the
  name of MoClo (such as MoClo YTK, MoClo CIDAR, MoClo EcloFlex, etc.). In
  this work, the original toolkit is named MoClo IG, and MoClo is used as an
  abbreviation of modular cloning as defined above.
