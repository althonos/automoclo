Documentation
-------------

The documentation is hosted on ``readthedocs.org``, and built against the latest
commit of the development repository. It contains a comprehensive API reference
as well as examples compiled from Jupyter notebooks at each build.


Base module
-----------

The base logic is handled by the core `moclo <https://github.com/althonos/moclo/tree/master/moclo-ytk>`_
module. It embbeds an object model of the MoClo system logic, but does not enforce
any specific sequence structure, and is not usable alone. You must install a kit
(listed below) to be able to validate and compute assemblies.


Kits
----

Additional kits can be installed separately depending on what's needed. The
following implementations are available:

* `Yeast ToolKit (moclo-ytk) <https://github.com/althonos/moclo/tree/master/moclo-ytk>`_
* `CIDAR Kit (moclo-cidar) <https://github.com/althonos/moclo/tree/master/moclo-cidar>`_
* `EcoFlex Kit (moclo-ecoflex) <https://github.com/althonos/moclo/tree/master/moclo-ecoflex>`_

Once installed, kits are available in theÂ ``moclo.kits`` package namespace.
`Kit-specific documentation <https://moclo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#kits>`_ is
available as well.
